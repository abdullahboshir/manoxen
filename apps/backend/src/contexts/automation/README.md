# Automation Context

This context is a **Supporting Context** in terms of DDD.

## Design Choice

By design, this context does not contain complex **Domain Entities** or **Value Objects**. It serves primarily as an **Application/Orchestration Layer** to handle background tasks, event-driven workflows, and automated system actions.

Logic here is focused on:

- Workflow execution
- Task scheduling
- Inter-context coordination
