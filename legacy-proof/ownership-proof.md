# Ownership & Proof of Origin

The Manoxen system is an evolution of previously developed software authored by **Abdullah Bashir** (Lead Developer/Architect).

## Original Projects

- **Signature Bangla POS (Backend)**
- **Signature Bangla POS (Frontend)**
- **Signature Bangla POS (Nest Server)**

## Statement of Ownership

This repository, **Manoxen**, is a continuation of the development lineage of the projects mentioned above. The legacy systems represent the foundation upon which Manoxen's modern architecture was built.

### Key Factors for Verification:

- **Authorship:** Same developer/organization identity across all systems.
- **Lineage:** Continuous development path from legacy to modern Monorepo.
- **Preservation:** The original repositories are preserved as immutable proof of work and authorship.

## Immutability Check

The legacy codebases remain in their original state and are not directly merged into Manoxen to maintain repository integrity and clear architectural boundaries.
