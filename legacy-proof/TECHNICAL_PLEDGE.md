# Technical Integrity & Authorship Pledge

## 📜 Declaration

I, **Abdullah Bashir**, the primary author and architect of **Manoxen**, hereby declare that this software is an original work and a direct intellectual continuation of the system architecture established in the **Signature Bangla POS** projects.

## ⚖️ Intellectual Property (IP) Status

- **Clean Room Continuation:** While Manoxen inherits the functional requirements and business logic patterns of its predecessors, it has been reimplemented from the ground up to utilize modern, high-performance technologies (TypeScript, Monorepo, DDD).
- **Originality:** Every core module, including the Multi-tenant Context Guard, the Domain-Driven Service Layer, and the Shared Library structure, has been authored specifically for this platform.
- **Dependency Integrity:** All third-party libraries used within this project are licensed under MIT, Apache 2.0, or other compatible open-source licenses. No GPL or restrictive license code has been merged into this repository.

## 🛡️ Reliability of Proof

The separate preservation of `signature-bangla-pos-backend` and `signature-bangla-pos-frontend` repositories serves as a permanent, immutable record of prior work and evolutionary lineage.
